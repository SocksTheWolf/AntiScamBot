## Why do you use the member/presence data access? Are you spying on me?

This is a question about this screen in particular:

And the answer is no.

Due to Discord API shenanigans, we need to enable these intents in order to be able to estimate how many servers a scammer is in when gathering information for a ban. We solely use that information to generate a count of how many servers. We do not keep track of which servers the scammer is in, nor do we save that information anywhere.

Seen below is an example of how we use these data intents:
