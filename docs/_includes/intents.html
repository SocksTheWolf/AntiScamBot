## Why do you use the member/presence data access? Are you spying on me?

This is a question about this screen in particular:

![{{ site.bot_name }} Data Access](/assets/botdataaccess.png){:.centered}

And the answer is no.

Due to Discord API shenanigans, we need to enable these intents for two reasons:

1. Being able to estimate how many servers a scammer is in when gathering information for a ban. 

2. Checking server permissions when someone runs the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/scamguard check</code>/activate</code> command in the TAG server.

We do not keep track of this information gathered, nor do we save that information anywhere

Seen below is an example of how we use these data intents when executing a ban:
