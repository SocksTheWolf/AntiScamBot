Currently, commission scammers are a scourge on our Discord communities. Unfortunately, unless they are banned in all relative servers, they'll hop onto the next server and then attempt to scam people from there next.

To stop this from happening, we share a ban list of known scammers so that the scammers are unable to contact anyone.

This bot is powered via community reporting, trusted verification, and complete transparency in all actions. 

When it comes to something as complicated as automatic ban handling, I want to make sure that you feel safe knowing that the decisions and actions done by the bot are 100% checkable. I do not want to have you deal with a case where someone is banned due to drama or disagreements.

Information will always be posted to the bot ban channel, as seen below:
