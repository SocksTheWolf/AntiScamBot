# AntiScamBot
A discord bot that shares commission scammer ban lists. These things are currently a scourge on our Discord communities. Unfortunately, unless they are banned in all relative servers, they'll hop onto the next server and then attempt to scam people from there next.

To stop this from happening, we share bans, so that the scammers are unable to contact anyone.
