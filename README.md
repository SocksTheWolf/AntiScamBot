# AntiScamBot

This is a Discord bot that bans scammers who offer unsolicited commissions to users of a discord server.

These scammers are a scourge on our Discord communities. Unfortunately, unless they are banned in all relative servers, theyâ€™ll hop onto the next server and then attempt to scam people from there next.

To stop this from happening, this bot shares a ban list of known scammers to any servers it is activated in such that the scammers are unable to contact anyone.

This bot is powered via community reporting, trusted verification, and complete transparency in all actions.
